  A basic tower strategy game designed to teach children (and adults) about sustainability.
  Uses a simple agent framework for modelling citizens surviving in their environment.
  Built on [node](http://nodejs.org) and [Express](http://express.org).
  Further information is available at the [Fierce-Planet blog](http://blog.fierce-planet.org)
  
## Installation

  Check out from GitHub, and install dependencies

    $ npm install

  Then set the MongoDB connection in app.js, and run:

    $ node app.js


## Quick Start

 The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable `express(1)` to generate an application as shown below:

 Create the app:

    $ npm install -g express
    $ express /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo

 Install dependencies:

    $ npm install -d

 Start the server:

    $ node app.js

## Node Compatibility

Fierce Planet 0.1.x is compatible with node 0.6.x.


## Running Tests

Fierce Planet uses to Jasmine for test coverage.

To run tests in Jasmine Node (from the command line):

    $ npm install jasmine-node
    $ node_modules/jasmine-node/bin/jasmine-node spec

To run tests in Jasmine Runner (from the browser), first get the slightly modifed version from:

    $ cd node_modules
    $ git clone git://github.com/doclm/jasmine-tool.git

(The modifications allow multiple files to be loaded as sources).
Then run:

    $ cd ..
    $ node_modules/jasmine-runner/bin/jasmine run

And direct the browser to http://localhost:8124/.


## Preparing for deployment

Fierce-Planet uses a *lot* of JavaScript files. Though it hasn't been thoroughly optimised,
a Jake script :

    $ node_modules/jasmine-runner/bin/jasmine run
